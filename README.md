# Telegram-data-analysis
NaUKMA Computational Social Science course final project.
The project works with two types of data: Users connected to me and messages I sent and received.
All the analysis was made with pandas.

### I've made 20 plots showing some pretty interesting stats.
Plots and stats were made with pandas, matplotlib, plotly.

## Some studies made.
* Most used words Wordclouds
* Favourite stickers
* Sent/received correlation
* Funny messages percentage
* My telegram activity stats(hours of activity, voice messages length)
* Messages I save
* Curse words usage in group chats
* Messages with links
         
## What studies can be done next?
* NLP
* News analysis
* Punctuation mistakes
* Attitude towards countries/leaders
* Citation index (fwd messages)
